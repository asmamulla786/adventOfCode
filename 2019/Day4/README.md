-->It is a six-digit number.
-->The value is within the range given in your puzzle input.
-->Two adjacent digits are the same (like 22 in 122345).
-->Going from left to right, the digits never decrease; they only ever increase or stay the same (like 111123 or 135679).

-->112233 meets these criteria because the digits never decrease and all repeated digits are exactly two digits long.
-->123444 no longer meets the criteria (the repeated 44 is part of a larger group of 444).
-->111122 meets the criteria (even though 1 is repeated more than twice, it still contains a double 22).
